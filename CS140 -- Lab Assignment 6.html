<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>

In this lab, you will gain familiarity with the binary search tree
data structure and the iterator abstraction. The first is a core data
structure. The latter is a core C++/STL concept.

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Your TAs will tell you how to submit your work in lab. 
The BST1.h file for Part 1 is due by 11.59pm Saturday Nov 7, 2015.
The BST2.h and BST3.h files for Parts 2 and 3 are due by 11.59pm Tuesday Nov 17, 2015.
Do not submit any cpp files. Your task is to update the binary search tree
template code which goes in the named header files.
<p>

</p><hr>
<h3>Programs you need to write </h3>

Write the following code. See the TAs well in advance
of the deadline to get your problems sorted out. Coming
to lab and office hours would be a good start. Nudge, nudge.

<ul>
<li>
Run the /home/cs140/labs/lab6/copy script or download
lab6.tar.gz from Blackboard to obtain the following files:
a skeleton header file called bst.h,
three source code driver programs called
BST_usage1.cpp, BST_usage2.cpp, and BST_usage3.cpp,
three x86-Linux executables called bst1, bst2, and bst3,
as well as two data files called
test1_int.txt and test2_int.txt for test purposes.
The executables showcase the functionality described next.
When in doubt about what to do, run these executable and study
the output.
Make sure your programs work on other data than the two files
given to you.
<p>

</p></li><li>
For 35 points,
create BST1.h which is needed to compile and run the BST1
program which is based on BST_usage1.cpp.
Copy bst.h to BST1.h. Strip out any code not needed 
(the iterator subclass and a few of the bst member functions).
Then add a parent pointer to the bst::node subclass and update
the bst::insert and bst::erase member functions to set 
this pointer during their normal mode of operation. Finally, update
bst::node::print to print the parent label if the parent exists
and NA otherwise. The driver program build a binary search tree
and then prints the result in terms of
a level-by-level dump
of node keys as well as parent and children keys.
See an output example below.
<p>

Be aware that the recursive bst::insert and bst::erase functions
do not have access to the parent when processing a node. 
You must therefore set the parent information as you ascend out 
of the recursion (when you reach the parent, you have access to the 
root of the subtree just processed).
Be on the lookout for NULL pointers to avoid seg faults.
</p><p>

</p></li><li>
For 90 points,
create BST2.h which is needed to compile and run the BST2
program which is based on BST_usage2.cpp.
Copy BST1.h to BST2.h and add the iterator subclass code
sketched in bst.h. The BST2 program uses iterator loops
to print the contents of a binary search tree after the data
has been read as well as after each of the user has erased
an arbitrary number of keys. See an output example below.
<p>

The bst::begin() function must return an iterator to the minkey node. 
The bst::end() function must return a NULL iterator, that is,
an iterator that points to NULL instead of a node.
The following set of iterator operators must be included: 
++ PRE increment for an inorder move to the next node,
* for dereferencing and thus access to the node key,
== and != for comparing iterators.
Base your code on the iterator code developed for the list class.
The handout remains available from Blackboard if
you have lost your hard copy. This might be a good time
to actually read and understand that handout.

</p><p>
The ++ PRE increment operator is by far the most complicated
of all the code you will write in this lab.
Before you even think about programming it, make sure you
know how to advance from one node to the next. Be aware that
you will NOT be using recursion. Each call to 
bst::iterator::operator++ must update the underlying (hidden)
node pointer to the next node as if you were doing an inorder
traversal. 
</p><p>

Function bst::begin() returns an iterator initialized to
point to the minkey node. Recall this node is the one 
furthest to the left in a binary search tree. 
You must process its right subtree (if it has any) before
returning to the parent node. The return could involve
traversing up a long sequence of subtrees. 
Be very careful when you ascend out of the tree when
the last node has been processed. That is, you must
detect trying to access the parent the root node since
it doesn't exist. If you don't, your code will seg fault.
</p><p>

Function bst::end() returns an iterator initialized to
a contain a NULL pointer. 

</p><p>
Friendly warning: Member functions of the iterator subclass
cannot use member functions from the bst class unless you
use inheritance and this topic isn't covered till cs302. In particular,
the ++ PRE increment operator cannot call the minkey function.
But fear not, you can incorporate the three lines of code needed
directly and get the job done that way. Sometimes brute force is
better than being clever.


</p></li><li>
For 75 points, 
create BST3.h which is needed to compile and run the BST3
program which is based on BST_usage3.cpp.
Copy BST2.h to BST3.h and add the bst::lower_bound, bst::upper_bound
and iterator based bst::erase functions sketched in bst.h. 
The BST3 program allows the user to specify a range of
data to erase. 
The specified min value sets a lower_bound
while
the specified max value sets a upper_bound. 
Data from the lower_bound up to but not including 
the upper bound is erased.
Think of these bounds as the index range used in an iterator
based for-loop: i0 is the initial value, while i1 is the end-check
value.
See an output example below.
<p>

The bst::lower_bound function must return an iterator to the
first node in the binary search tree whose key is not less
than the given min key. 
If the min key exists, the returned
iterator points to that node.
If the min key does not exist, the returned 
iterator points to the first node whose key value is greater.
</p><p>

The bst::upper_bound function must return an iterator to the
first node in the binary search tree whose key is strictly
greater than the given max key. 
If the max key exists, the returned
iterator points to the next node when performing an
inorder traversal.
If the max key does not exist, the returned 
iterator matched the return value of the bst::end() function.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The bst::erase function takes two iterator arguments that
define the range of nodes to erase from the binary search tree.
This function should implemented as a wrapper function 
that calls the private bst::erase member function to erase
one node at a time.
Since erasing a node changes the structure of the binary
search tree, the new bst::erase function must first create
a list of keys to erase (e.g. using a vector container).
